# My HSE React homework

## hw-2
I've created my first React app!

## hw-3
So, this time I've created a pre-filled to-do list with some tasks. Every task has a button to check if this task is completed or not.

## hw-4
Ugly neuomorphic redesign. Now you have a possibility to add tasks and complete them. If you complete a task it goes right to the end of the task list. If you return your completed task it goes to the start, like new tasks do. Also added a bit of comments.

## hw-5
New interface and theme changer.
